### Bitcoin Electronic Waste Comparison

The bitcoin electronic waste produces per Bitcoin transaction by this [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921344921005103)
is 272g/transaction (in 2021).

Total electronic waste in 2021 according to file [bitcoin_ewaste_per_day_2021.csv](data/bitcoin_ewaste_per_day_2021.csv)- this
is also the result of the plugin calculation:

- Plugin total ewaste = 7473678474(g)
  Total bitcoin transactions in 2021 taken from [this file ](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2949790623000046-mmc1.xlsx) - This file
  is the data for this [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949790623000046#:~:text=estimate%20that%20Bitcoin%20mining%20was,manage%20the%20limited%20freshwater%20supply.):
  
  Total bitcoin transaction 2021 = 96670416
- Plugin e waste per transaction 2021 = 7473678474/96670416 = 77g


The number 272g derived from the paper under assumption that average
lifespan of bitcoin mining equipment is 1.3 years but this has been [disputed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_effects_of_bitcoin#Electronic_waste:~:text=A%202024%20systematic%20review%20criticized%20this%20estimate%20and%20argued%2C%20based%20on%20market%20sales%20and%20IPO%20data%2C%20that%20bitcoin%20mining%20hardware%20lifespan%20was%20closer%20to%204â€“5%20years.%5B28%5D).
A [study](https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.bcra.2023.100169) estimates the average lifespan to be 4-5 years.

If we take 5 years as lifespan (the lifespan used in this plugin methodology), then
the number would be 272 * 1.3/5 = 70g. This result is very close to the value
produced by the plugin.
