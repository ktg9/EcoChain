Project name: EcoChain - Sustainable Blockchain Environmental Impacts Measurement<br>

## Introduction

### Blockchain energy consumption problem
Blockchain is one of the fastest growing field these days. Since the creation of Bitcoin
in 2008, the market value has grown to an estimation of 1.09 trillion $ as of August 2023 according
to CoinMarketCap.<br>
The blockchain sector has grown from only a single cryptocurrency (bitcoin) to a vast ecosystem that includes
hundreds of blockchain networks, Defi, smart contract,... fueling the creation of big names like Binance, Uniswap,...<br>
However, along with the development, blockchain also have dark sides and one of it is large
energy consumption.
Bitcoin alone is estimated to consume 127 terawatt-hours (TWh) a year â€” more than many countries, including Norway.
In the United States, cryptocurrency activity is estimated to emit from 25 to 50 million tons of CO2 each year, on par with the annual emissions from diesel fuel used by US railroads.


### Effort to estimate the energy consumption of blockchains

Although just in initial state, there have been various methodologies/estimations
aimed at measuring energy consumption of blockchain systems. <br>
The [Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute](https://indices.carbon-ratings.com/?)
has conducted several researches and produced statistics that are widely used in reports.
The [Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index](https://ccaf.io/cbnsi/cbeci) is another excellent
source.

### Goal of this plugin
As stated, there are many good estimation done by numerous organization with solid research
background about blockchain energy consumption. However, the majority of estimations
are about showing how much energy the entire blockchain network consume. While this is excellent in showing blockchain users the overral environmental impact of
blockchains, those numbers dont show blockchain users the impact of their actions (in participating in crypto market) on the environment. <br>

Blockchain users includes cryptocurrency investors, smart contract developers, financial organizations using blockchain
as their technology and many more. <br>

This GSF plugin aims at showing the normal users (investors, developers,...) the impact of their actions on environment
while interacting with blockchain ecosystems. Specifically, this plugin will try to answer these questions to blockchain users:
- I am a cryptocurrency user, how much energy is spent when I transfer some bitcoin
  to another wallet?
- I am a smart contract developer, how much energy my smart contract will cost when it's
  deployed in different blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche...?
- How much energy USDC cost?

I believe a quantification of how much energy associated with users actions will be impactful
and better educate users about blockchain environmental issue as a whole. And that's this plugin
is about, to show the majority of blockchains users their actions' impact by calculating how much energy
their transaction will consume.
